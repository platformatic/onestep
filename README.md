# GitHub Action to deploy a Platformatic app to Platformatic Cloud

As we hone in on delivering our [Node command center](http://platformatichq.com/), we have made the decision to deprecate our  cloud offering.
We understand that this decision may impact you and your business, and we want to assure you that we are here to answer any questions you may have. To get in touch, please contact us on info@platformatic.dev or via our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/platformatic).
